## Hack-a-Thing 2.0

Created by Grace Miller, Tommy Kiernan and Zach Tannenbaum

For this milestone, we attempted to create a basic react redux chrome extension
in order to start our project with a skeleton and have a base to work from. This
also helped us to start learning react (for Tommy and Zach) and more specifically
redux (for Grace).

For this project we used a boilerplate react extension from
https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-chrome-extension-boilerplate and then modified
it to create our basic implementation.

Through the process of refactoring, we began to learn how redux worked and how
webpack and babel were integrated into the development process. There is definitely
some learning still to be done for react, but this project served as a basic attempt
at learning the framework in the setting of a chrome extension.

We struggled with using the chrome extension apis which tend to be asynchronous.
This will be something we will have to figure out going forward.
